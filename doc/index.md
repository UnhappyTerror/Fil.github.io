For recent few decades, the arctic regions have gone through major rapid climate changes, directly affecting the geology of the environment. There are damages done to the communities on the coastline and permafrost terrains as the terrains erode. The PIPER project (People Infrastructure Permafrost Resilience) addresses this problem by understand the relationship and mutual impacts of continued climate change in the arctic reflected in the following components: permafrost degradation and coastal erosion, civil infrastructure and development, and community well-being and sociodemographic and cultural resilience.

Currently, the required high-resolution imageries are only available in high temporal resolutions (low frequency of imageries throughout the year). In order to make up for this shortcoming, imageries with high temporal resolutions are adopted for the studies. However, the high temporal resolution imageries are often low in spatial (visual) resolution, limiting the clear understanding of the coastline erosions. 

This team's project was focused on helping the project gain better insight of the coastal erosion through improving the resolution of the satellite imageries. By having access to higher resolution imageries of the target regions, significant connections can be deduced between the possible causes and the erosion status. The super resolution algorithms implemented for this project were SRCNN (Super Resolution Convoluted Neural Network) and SRResnet (Super Resolution -----). Two models were ran in comparison using the same images of test set, yielding PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) scores.



# Introduction on Super Resolution technology




# Methods
The project underwent the following steps.
1. Compare the models that are currently being used; SRCNN and SRResnet
2. Compare the two models by PSNR score, pick the best model to use for Dr Farquharson.
3. Create the pipeline for Dr Farquharson. (Ideally simple enough that she only has to type in image size and file location.)
4. Designing and submitting Github project presentation page
### SRCNN
### SRResNet
